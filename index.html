<p class="yeah-whatever">Hello tiny humans! *waves* Welcome to my lair...</p>
        <p>My name is Phaedra and you can't call me anything else because so far, no-one has come up with any real nicknames for me :) </p> 
<p class="another-one">Some Stuff I Wrote That You're Going To Read Whether You Like It Or Not (with pictures): </p>
    <p>I'm a thirteen-and-three-quarter year old white fangirl from New Zealand. 
    <p>I'm homeschooled at the moment. 
    <p>I'm doing this coding program with my friend Raley Torkington.<p><img src="images/us.JPG" width="200"></p>
    <p>I live in Matakana, a small village roughly an hour north of Aukland.
    <p>My phone is a horcrux. No, like seriously, my soul is imprinted in that thing. 
    <p>I love my music like I love my life (80's-90's bands are just ace...) but unfortunately I lost my ipod and haven't replaced it yet.
    <p>I recently cut my hair short which was probably the worst mistake of my life so far.
    <p>When I sing it sounds like a wailing cat that has just been dipped in yellow paint and used as a tennis ball.
    <p>I like to read :)
    <p>Morrissey, Brandon Flowers, Benedict Cumberbatch and David Tennant make me happy. Asdfghjkl.

    <p>I own a lil baby cat that adopted my family and his name is Banjo. He is the incarnation of Satan.

    <p>See that little front-facing "selfie" camera at the top of your laptop? The government says hello!
    <p>Tea.
    <p>My room is ALWAYS a mess. Grrrr.
    <p>If you own a pocketwatch (and use it) then i think you're ace...
    <p>When I grow up I want to live in Chamonix or Reykjavik.
